Tree model is one of the most common models in machine learning field. Although tree model is straightforward and easy to understand, it has weak prediction power because its prediction result relies heavily on the specific dataset showed to it. Thus, tree model is seldom used in solving reality problems.   

However, I have found a quite interesting usage of the simple tree model. I use it to build colour blocks upon an art work and it returns amazing results.
